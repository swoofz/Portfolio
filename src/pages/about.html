                &emsp;Hi, my name is Jordan Hall. I am currently studying for a game programming degree at the University of Advancing Technology. Before going to UAT I went to a web development bootcamp call General Assembly. There I learned how to do full stack web development but also learn that I rather code games. A little after I finished at GA, I start at UAT and learn a lot about game programming. Most of the project that we had to build, we built them using Unity3D. I finished up most of the game programming requires and now all that is left is Gen Ed and my SIP class. Before my SIP class started I was in production studios, which has students work on Greenlight project the school approve on so they can get a feel how it is like to work in teams and real world game dev jobs. I currently have a year and a half till I finish my degree at UAT.
