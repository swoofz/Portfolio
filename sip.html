        <h3>Technical Field</h3>
        <p>This project involves the technical field of programming.</p>
        <h3>Background Information</h3>
        <p>
            I got my inspiration to create this project by watching anime and wanting to see something I
            thought would be interesting to put in a game.
        </p>
        <h3>Prior Art (legal term)</h3>
        <p>
            My inspiration does not come from a game that already exists, but an anime called “Death Marth
            to the Parallel World Rhapsody”. The anime is in a game like theme where the player/Character
            goes through the world and learns things by experiencing them. The pro for to video game is that
            it gives players more of a sense that there is infinite number of things they can do. A con to a
            system like this is that it can be overwhelming at first from all the things that can be done.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            My project will be a system that changes abilities based on the player’s actions. There will be
            event that player will be doing, and each event can affect the stats on the ability that the player
            might get. This will benefit the player because they can play the game in different ways than
            another player and different each time they play if played multiple times.
        </p>
        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>This project innovation is that events that are created can affect the ability stats of the player.</p>
        <h3>Usage Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            Describe a scenario involving a typical use of your system/design OTHER than the use you will
            be demonstrating in your project. You are trying to sell the reader on the idea behind your
            application and what its intended use is, so be clear. How could this innovation be used beyond

            Commented [KD1]: Be sure to integrate your SME’s
            feedback as needed to hone this as sharply as possible. 
            the product you are demonstrating? Remember to avoid 1st person, and to avoid a “story-telling”
            style of writing. And, if all else fails and you are having difficulty describing a “Usage
            Scenario”, you can focus on describing the Demographic for your project/product.
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            Start this section with a statement like: “The following questions will identify the successful
            completion of the project.” Then, in the form of “Yes/No” questions, list the criteria you/your
            team will use to determine the success/completion of your project in terms of usability or
            usefulness of the product you will eventually prototype. Provide as many criteria as required to
            assure the quality of the project; each one needs to be expressed in such a way that it is
            measurable or observable, and should be in the form of a yes or no question. Also, do NOT
            answer the questions. This is simply a list of what the criteria are.
        </p>
        <h3>Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project</h3>
        <p>
            List and describe the High-Level objectives of this project. These should include the targeted
            areas of completion that will guarantee the success of your project. (Each objective will
            eventually have several tasks associated with it.)
            After giving the objectives, list and describe all tasks that will allow you to complete each
            objective. Tasks are the specific actions required to achieve the objectives. The Evaluation
            Criteria mentioned above will ensure that the quality is ultimately measurable or observable.
            Each task shall be described in detail and include transparency on the decision-making process.
            Use headings for each task to maintain clarity in the documentation. Use dates (if known) to
            specify when the tasks will be completed and implemented.
            Note: This section will be drafted in SIP311, but must be revised prior to SIP403(or SIP409) to
            describe tasks as they actually occurred.
        </p>
        <h3>Description of Design Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            Describe the design prototype implementation. You should describe the platform on which the
            system will be built and provide directions on how to run the prototype (if necessary). Elaborate
            on the functionality of the parts that define your project. Effective descriptions will give the
            reader an understanding of what the design prototype will be, and how it relates to the final
            project.
            Note: This section will be drafted in SIP311, but must be revised prior to SIP403 (or SIP409) to
            describe the design prototype in its final form.
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Provide a complete, paragraph style description of the plan that is to be used to evaluate your
            project. This section should be a description of the full plan for how the team will go about
            answering the “Evaluation Criteria” questions. Do not simply repeat the questions!
            Note: This section will be drafted in SIP311, but must be revised prior to SIP403 (or SIP409) to
            describe the full evaluation plan as it was actually implemented.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Completion Assessment</h3>
        <p>
            Note: This section must completed prior to SIP403/409.
            Provide an in-depth description of the completion assessment of your project. Describe how well
            the completed components function and highlight the innovative facets of your design. This is
            sometimes known as a “Post-Mortem” or “Lessons-Learned Report”. A good approach for this
            section is to answer the following 4 questions: “What went right? What went wrong? What was
            learned throughout the process? What would be done differently if you had to do it again?
        </p>
        <h3>Appendices</h3>
        <p>
            Note: While students are encouraged to start citing their sources as soon as SIP311, this section must
            completed prior to SIP403/409. For SIP402 (or SIP408), use this as a way to share your progress
            TOWARDS completion with your SME
            Include as appendices any supporting material for this project, including charts, graphs, and other
            data; images associated with the project; or other documentation (e.g., a game design document
            or read-me file). Include any prior art that was used such as U.S. Patent Documents, Foreign
            Patent Documents, or other sources. Remember that this section should only be a list of
            additional files, not the actual data of the files!
            Use the following format:
            Appendix letter: description of item – file name
            Example…
            Appendix A: Game design document – myGameDoc.docx
            Appendix B: 3D render of primary character – mainCharacter.jpg
            Appendix C: References
            Author. (date). etc, following APA style.
