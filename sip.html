        <h3>Technical Field</h3>
        <p>This project involves the technical field of programming.</p>

        <h3>Background Information</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;I got my inspiration to create this project by watching anime and wanting to see something I thought would be interesting to put in a game. I always wanted to try to play a game with a world that is always changing, and everyone is different. In most games that I have played, the only things that seems different from player to player is playstyle. The reason the anime I watched gave me inspiration was because the anime itself was set in a game like world, so it got me think what that would be like to play when everyone that plays will be different.
        </p>

        <h3>Prior Art (legal term)</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;My inspiration does not come from a game that already exist but an anime call “Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody”. The anime is in a game like theme where the player/Character goes through the world and learn things by experiencing them. The pro for to video game is that it gives players more of a sense that there is infinite number of things they can do. A con to a system like this is that it can be overwhelming at first from all the things that can be done.<br>
            &emsp;Like I said before my idea doesn’t come from a game that exist, but my idea came in mind with the thought of make into an mmorpg or any games that have abilities and progression such as The Wither 3, Rift, ect. In games like this progression of abilities is usually in what is called a skill tree. In my idea I like to say abilities progress is something like an “invisible skill tree”, but that’s only a visualization to generate a picture what I am talk about. In more detail, normal skill trees modifications to abilities are predetermined, while in the invisible skill tree all modifications are generated by player actions with their abilities.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            My project will be a system that changes abilities based on the players actions. The actions will be how and when player use the ability to calculate how the ability will change. All abilities will track how the ability was used. The information that will be track will be used to determine how the abilities will change. I will achieve this using Unity to be able to get a working prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>
            This project innovation is that abilities will change based on how players you them.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;For this project, the usage scenario is any game that uses abilities/spell that the developers want to change if the player does certain events and effects the stats. For example, if a player learned an ability related to ice and they did an event that used a similar ability but in a different way. The player’s character could learn the how to adapt its own ice abilities to be similar to the ice ability they come across when doing the event. With that the player can have different forms of the ice abilities they learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            The following questions will identify the successful completion of the project.
        <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <li>Can player learn/upgrade their abilities through event and experiences?</li>
            <li>Can designer easily create scenarios that have a chance to change ability stat?</li>
            <li>Does the player have the ability to use the different style of abilities?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project</h3>

        <h3>Description of Design Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;This prototype is built using Unity3d. This system allows to have spells that are created by the designer to be able to adapt over time based on how to player uses their skills. In this prototype, skills will change using weights that track player actions.  When player uses their skills, the action in which the skill was used will be tracked. A visual of the stats for the skill will change when calculation get applied.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;In this prototype I will be calculating weights from each skill then apply them when ready. For testing purposes, I will be creating a UI that I can enter values for the weight that will be use the calculate the spell stats changing. After I know that is working find I will be creating ways to add to weight values when player does an action. I will test with an attack skill using collision and seeing if the values change and then get applied after reaching its goal. All this will be seen using a UI to display the skill’s stats.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Completion Assessment</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;Currently I have built working skills. I hit a roadblock on how to achieve my goal of changing the skills based on player usage. I came up with an idea of how to do it but am still working out the parameters to make it work. This is really the main thing I need to work out for the project to be close to completion.
        </p>
