        <h3>Technical Field</h3>
        <p>This project involves the technical field of programming.</p>

        <h3>Background Information</h3>
        <p>
            I got my inspiration to create this project by watching anime and wanting to see something I thought would be interesting to put in a game.
        </p>

        <h3>Prior Art (legal term)</h3>
        <p>
            My inspiration does not come from a game that already exists, but an anime called “Death Marth to the Parallel World Rhapsody”. The anime is in a game like theme where the player/Character goes through the world and learns things by experiencing them. The pro for to video game is that it gives players more of a sense that there is infinite number of things they can do. A con to a system like this is that it can be overwhelming at first from all the things that can be done.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            My project will be a system that changes abilities based on the player’s actions. There will be scenarios that player will end up doing, and each scenario can affect the stats on the abilities that the player uses. This will benefit the player because they can play the game in different ways than another player and different each time they play if played multiple times.
        </p>

        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>
            This project innovation is that the data on the abilities will be used to update how to they work later on.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, the usage scenario is any game that uses abilities/spell that the developers want to change if the player does certain events and effects the stats. For example, if a player learned an ability related to ice and they did an event that used a similar ability but in a different way. The player’s character could learn the how to adapt its own ice abilities to be similar to the ice ability they come across when doing the event. With that the player can have different forms of the ice abilities they learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            The following questions will identify the successful completion of the project.
        <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <li>Can player learn/upgrade their abilities through event and experiences?</li>
            <li>Can designer easily make a new event for a chance to change ability stat.</li>
            <li>Does the player have the ability to use the different style of abilities?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Goal</strong> – Create a system that takes how an ability was used and changed it based on that experience.

        <h3>Description of Design Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            This prototype is built using Unity3d. This system is set up to allow designer to create events that the player can do if choice to do so. For this show of the system, you can move around and there are places you can go. Getting to the places may chance to stats of the ability you have shown on the screen. Depending the order in which you go to each place will determine what your stats will look like.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <p>
            In this prototype of the player learn their abilities by exploring and having their character learn the world around them. Since this was something small the exploring is not that far or that event full. That can all be changed by the designer to set up the world event that they want the player to follow to get to a certain point of progression. In each stage of progression, the player will still have the older version of their abilities and can use them whenever they like to.
        </p>
