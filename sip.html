        <h3>Technical Field</h3>
        <p>This project involves the technical field of programming.</p>

        <h3>Background Information</h3>
        <p>
            I got my inspiration to create this project by watching anime and wanting to see something I
            thought would be interesting to put in a game.
        </p>

        <h3>Prior Art (legal term)</h3>
        <p>
            My inspiration does not come from a game that already exists, but an anime called “Death Marth
            to the Parallel World Rhapsody”. The anime is in a game like theme where the player/Character
            goes through the world and learns things by experiencing them. The pro for to video game is that
            it gives players more of a sense that there is infinite number of things they can do. A con to a
            system like this is that it can be overwhelming at first from all the things that can be done.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            My project will be a system that changes abilities based on the player’s actions. There will be
            event that player will be doing, and each event can affect the stats on the ability that the player
            might get. This will benefit the player because they can play the game in different ways than
            another player and different each time they play if played multiple times.
        </p>

        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>This project innovation is that events that are created can affect the ability stats of the player.</p>

        <h3>Usage Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, the usage scenario is any game that uses abilities/spell that the developers want to change if the player does certain events and effects the stats. For example, if a player learned an ability related to ice and they did an event that used a similar ability but in a different way. The player’s character could learn the how to adapt its own ice abilities to be similar to the ice ability they come across when doing the event. With that the player can have different forms of the ice abilities they learn. 
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            The following questions will identify the successful completion of the project.
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Can player learn/upgrade their abilities through event and experiences?</li>
                <li>Can designer easily make a new event for a chance to change ability stat.</li>
                <li>Does the player have the ability to use the different style of abilities?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Goal</strong> – A system that changes abilities stats based on an event the player experience.
            <ol style="margin: 5px 0 0 50px;">
                
                <li><strong>Objective 1</strong> – Create a UI to show the ability stats.</li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin: 3px 20px">
                    <li>Show the current stats value and what they do in an easy to read form.</li>
                    <li>Code the stat’s details to show the current stats.</li>
                    <li>Code an ability the player can have.</li>
                </ol>

                
                <li><strong>Objectives 2</strong> – Design an event that will affect the player ability.</li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin: 3px 20px">
                    <li>Code a system to take that designers can create events that can affect player ability.</li>
                    <li>Design a test event full of objectives the player must complete or take part in.</li>
                    <li>Link the system code to change player ability stats.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <li><strong>Objective 3</strong> - Create an ability system</li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin: 3px 20px">
                    <li>Design a UI to store abilities.</li>
                    <li>Code ability to be able to be created by designers.</li>
                    <li>Create a few test abilities to show off the system.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
